Now in your fifties, the parents have passed  
to that passive phrase, that elusive place.  
The branches you bent to find your way home  
have disappeared. Taken by blight or overgrowth.  
With the grinning blade of the butcher knife,  
you lean into the proverbial forest,  
worry not how you will eat, but how to hunger.  
You start by building a lean-to, discover  
that perfect branch you mistake for the forest
